# Tic - Tac - Toe

A single player and Simple Page Game.
Two people can play together on a same computer, one is X and another is O.

In the game, user can sign up their own account and sign in with that account.
Also, user can change password and sign out if their want.

During the game, player can create the new game and update the imformation.

# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AJAX


# Development Process and Problem-solving Strategy

For the start, I draw a framework about my program which include sign-in, sign-up,
change-password, sign-out and the game-board.

And then, start from the html and then focus on the JavaScript also the CSS. After all of these,
I add the API(sent and recieve data with server).

The Strategy I use to complete this program is trying to sepertate the big problem into some small
problems, And make a planning schedule.

Make git commit after everytime I finish a small function.

# Unsolved Problems

- Add Game History function
- Add different style choices that user can change and choose whatever they want.
- Add background music
- Add multiple player on a same gameboard (two player from different computer and some player can watch them)
